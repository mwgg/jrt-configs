# Overlay configs for Joel Real Timing (JRT)

These are my personal overlay configs, and are a constant work in progress as I tweak them to better suit my personal needs. Due to the highly configurable nature of JRT, feel free to use them as they are, or as a starting point for your own overlays.

## Installation
Drop the contents of the `configs` directory into `%UserProfile%\Documents\Joel Real Timing\import - export`.

Inside JRT Config open `JRT Pages` and select any of the `Timing`, `Dashboard` or `Trackmap` pages, click `Load`, and you should see the option to replace the existing config with one of mine, prefixed with `mwgg`. 

If you already had a modified config, make sure to export it first.

## Pages
### Dashboard
Everything you need in one compact UI.
* Gear, speed, clutch/brake/throttle inputs
* Number of laps or minutes remaining
* Rev lights
* Delta to session best lap time
* Fuel calculator
* Laps until pit window opens
* Brake bias
* Last and session best lap times
* Incident count and limit
* Track temp
* Session type
* SOF

The bottom section lights up for green, yellow and blue flags, the top section lights up when ABS is activated.

You can replace any of the elements with any other relatively easily, if you know the basics of how to deal with JRT.

### Standings
A relatively compact standings display with just the necessities.

### Relative
Once again, just the basics.

### Track map
Mostly as it comes with JRT, with some tweaks to better highlight the selected driver.
